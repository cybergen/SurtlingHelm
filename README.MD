The Viking afterlife is great, but chopping down one solitary tree at a time, dodging constant Greydwarf ambushes, can really get exhausting. The Surtling Helm is a new piece of equipment that throws away all that silly balance and pacing, cranks everything up to 13, and lets you rain nuclear death across the land.

## Guide

To get your helmet, first:

* [Install BepInEx](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/denikson/BepInExPack_Valheim/)
* [Install the HookGen patcher](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/ValheimModding/HookGenPatcher/)
* [Install ValheimLib](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/ValheimModding/ValheimLib/) in order to get access to all these features!
* Copy this SurtlingHelm .dll file into your BepInEx/plugins folder
* Find a basic workbench and craft your purple hood of imminent death! (for a one-time fee of Surtling Cores and Troll Hide)

You can also edit the cost of the helm, as well as its damage by changing the config at BepInEx/config/SurthlingHelm.cfg

On the other side awaits all these features!
